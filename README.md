# lintmatter

A linter that checks agent context files such as `AGENTS.md` and `SKILL.md` for proper formatting and best practices.

Features:
- Detects broken references
- Validates skill frontmatter
- Validates token budgets for skills and AGENTS.md

## Quick start

Install:
```sh
curl -LsSf https://github.com/rsn491/lintmatter/releases/latest/download/lintmatter-installer.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, you can install via npm, Homebrew, or Cargo:
```sh
npm install -g lintmatter
brew install rsn491/tap/lintmatter
cargo install lintmatter
```

Once installed, run it in your repo:
```sh
lintmatter .
```

## Usage

```sh
lintmatter [flags] [path...]
```

Paths may be files or directories. Directories are walked recursively for
`AGENTS.md` and `SKILL.md`. 

Examples:
```sh
# lint the whole repository against the default budgets
lintmatter .

# just the skills, with a tighter body budget
lintmatter --max-skill-tokens 2000 skills/

# CI: fail on warnings too, machine-readable output
lintmatter --strict --format json .
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--max-agents-tokens` | `2500` | Body token budget for `AGENTS.md` |
| `--max-skill-tokens` | `5000` | Body token budget for `SKILL.md` |
| `--max-skill-name-tokens` | `16` | Budget for a skill's `name` |
| `--max-skill-description-tokens` | `100` | Budget for a skill's `description` |

### Rules

| Rule | Severity | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `frontmatter.missing` | error | The skill has no front-matter block |
| `frontmatter.not-first` | error | The fence does not open on line 1 |
| `frontmatter.unterminated` | error | The opening fence is never closed |
| `frontmatter.invalid` | error | Not parseable YAML, or not a mapping |
| `frontmatter.unknown-key` | warning | Key outside `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools` (the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter) fields), plus the Claude Code extensions `disable-model-invocation` and `argument-hint` |
| `name.required` | error | `name` is present and a non-empty string |
| `name.format` | error | `name` matches `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$` |
| `name.length` | error | `name` is at most 64 characters |
| `name.dir-mismatch` | warning | `name` matches the containing directory |
| `description.required` | error | `description` is present and a non-empty string |
| `description.length` | error | `description` is at most 1024 characters |
| `allowed-tools.type` | error | A list of names, or a comma-separated string |
| `metadata.type` | error | A mapping when present |
| `tokens.content` | error | Body within its token budget |
| `tokens.name` | error | `name` within its token budget |
| `tokens.description` | error | `description` within its token budget |
| `file-reference.missing` | error | Every relative markdown link outside inline code, and every `./`- or `../`-prefixed file path in inline code, resolves to a file that exists |

Switch any of them off by id:
```sh
lintmatter --disable name.dir-mismatch --disable frontmatter.unknown-key .
```

Rules (along with token budgets and excludes) can also be set in a
`.lintmatter.yaml` config file instead of passing flags every time — see
[`.lintmatter.yaml`](.lintmatter.yaml) for an example.

## Score

Each file is rated 0–100 as the mean of three parts:

| Part | How it rates |
| --- | --- |
| Front matter | Frontmatter rules that passed ÷ frontmatter rules applied |
| Token budgets | 100 if within the budget, reaching 0 once a file is double its budget. E.g. 10% over budget scores 90; 50% over scores 50. A skill's `name` and `description` budgets average in with its body |
| File references | 100 if every checked reference resolves, 0 if any is broken |

Scores are rounded down, so a file rates only the band it has fully earned:
a mean of 87.5 reports 87. The run's score is the mean of the file scores,
rounded down the same way.

## Running on CI

```yaml
- name: Lint agent instruction files
  run: |
    curl -LsSf https://github.com/rsn491/lintmatter/releases/latest/download/lintmatter-installer.sh | sh
    lintmatter --strict .
```

## Development

Build:
```sh
cargo build --release
```

Run tests:
```sh
cargo test
```

Format and lint:
```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Pre-commit hooks run `fmt`, `clippy`, `check`, `test`, and lintmatter's own self-lint
automatically. To install them:
```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
